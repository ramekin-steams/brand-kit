# Logo Usage Guidelines

This document describes the correct usage of brand logos to ensure
visual consistency and brand integrity.

## Clear Space
Always maintain sufficient clear space around the logo so it remains
legible and visually distinct from other elements.

## Backgrounds
- Use the primary logo on light backgrounds.
- Use the inverted or monochrome logo on dark backgrounds.
- Avoid placing logos on visually noisy or low-contrast backgrounds.

## Do Not
- Stretch or distort the logo
- Change logo colors
- Apply shadows, gradients, or effects
- Rotate or crop the logo

## File Formats
Use SVG for digital products and PNG for raster-based assets when SVG
is not supported.
